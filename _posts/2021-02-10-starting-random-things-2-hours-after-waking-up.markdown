I don't know if this is just me but sometimes I feel very ADHD. It has been only a few hours since I got up and so far I have decided to pursue a career in building spaceships, making trading bot from scratch (because of the recent frenzy with crypto and stock markets), start making indie games and start painting for fun... All going on while I am not working on projects that I have already started like my online gaming community [GGTime](https://ggtime.io) that I was building. This realization came to me when I walked over to my brother's room while he was working (remote work thanks to Covid) and randomly stated I was going to build indie games because it would align with the same goal of my [GGTime](https://ggtime.io) community. He replied, "Why not just focus on building your community and not making this game?". That hit me like a slap in the face. All this time, what I have been preaching to everyone; which is the power of compounding; is the one thing that I am guilty of not following through with.

What I have learned is that I need to write down more concrete plans on how I am executing my ideas. For [GGTime](https://ggtime.io), it is to set a schedule for how many interviews I am going to send out for that blog. I also need to visibly see my schedule every morning. I am thinking about using a Chrome extension which shows your goals for the day when you open up a new tab. This would be a great way to be reminded constantly. To help with my scatter brain, I need to start meditating again. I have a hard time getting myself to do it when I wake up, so I am going to aim to do it mid day around lunch.

Also blogging like this has been very therapeutic and reflective, so I am going to keep doing this when something clicks in my mind!
